In this tutorial, we will build the final piece part of the database.

Report

:   A report is a well-formatted document suitable for printing. It can
    draw data from any part of a database, such as a query or table.

Tutorial
--------

For this tutorial, follow the video above. It shows a couple of interesting ways to generate reports and some interesting reports you can generate with this database. Once you complete that move on to the next section.

### Create One More Report

Create one more report from any query(s) or table(s) of your choice. I highly recommend this report be based on one of the queries you made in the previous tutorial, because then they will be unique and interesting. When you are finished, simply upload the database file as is to Canvas.
