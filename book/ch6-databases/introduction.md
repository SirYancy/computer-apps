Databases
=========

A database is a collection of data. Good database software allows the
user to add data, access it, and analyze that data and will have many
built-in tools to make this quick and easy. They are perhaps the single
most important piece of software that a computer possesses and most
people are completely unaware of them. Don't take this as a criticism of most people. That databases are largely invisible is absolutely by design! Software engineers go to great lengths to hide databases behind user-friendly interfaces to enhance user experience and security.

For this course, we will focus on [LibreOffice Base](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/base/), because it comes with
a relatively easy-to-use built-in interface, but there are many, many
other options out there of varying levels of complexity.
