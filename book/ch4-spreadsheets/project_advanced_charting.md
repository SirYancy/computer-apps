PROJECT - Advanced Weather Data
===============================

In this project, you are largely on your own. You will be given a link
to several interesting sets of data. It will be your job to look at what
data there is, and see what was you can build interesting-looking charts
from them. This is totally open-ended, but there are a few guidelines:

Directions
----------

[Data Files](http://erickuha.com/primer/excel_resources/weather/)

1.  Each chart should be accompanied by a description of *why* this
    chart is interesting. However, brief it might be.
2.  All of the files in the directory are .csv files. This means that
    they must be converted to actual spreadsheet files *or* imported
    into Excel. Both of these ideas will be covered in class.
3.  No low-effort submissions. You are going to build **five (5)**
    charts. That's not that many. Make sure each one has something
    interesting about it.
4.  If you have an interesting idea for a chart, but are not sure how to
    implement that idea, *ask the instructor*. We'll figure out a way to
    get you where you want to go. Excel is powerful, but with all power
    comes complexity.
