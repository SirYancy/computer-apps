PROJECT - Baseball Salaries
===========================

In this project, you will download a large data set that outlines the
names, positions, teams, and salaries of Major League Baseball players
in 2016. The file comes as a .csv, which is not actually a spreadsheet,
so you will have to remember to save it as an Excel file before you do
anything with it.

Here's how:
-----------

1.  Download the [start file](res/baseball.csv)
2.  Open the file in Microsoft Excel. You should see the data displayed
    as normal.
3.  Click the **File** tab and in the backstage view, click **Save As**

4.  Click **Browse**. In the *Save As* dialog, navigate to your
    preferred folder, and then in the *Save as type:* dropdown, select
    **Excel Workbook (*.xlsx)*\*

Now that your file is saved, format the data as a table by clicking
inside the data (anywhere) and pressing **Ctrl-a** on your keyboard.
This selects all of the data. Use the **Format as Table** tool in the
**Home** tab and you're ready to go.

You know how to create a pivot table (hint: it's in the **Insert** tab)

Create a new blank sheet called *Answers*. Use what you know about pivot
tables to answer the following questions, and then enter them into the
*Answers* sheet.

Your answer sheet will look something like this:
