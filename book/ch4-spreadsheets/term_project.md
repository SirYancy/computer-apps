# ITECH 150 - Excel Term Project

For the final project, you will create, from scratch, a spreadsheet. This will present challenges and will take some time to plan. In fact, planning is one of the most important steps in this project.

## Planning

First, you must decide what project you want to do. There are many different possibilities, but if you have never done this before, you may want to stick to the suggestions in the list below. In any case, the first part of this project will be the submission of a proposal and plan. It will be in the form a text entry on the course portal. An outline of what your project will look like and what it will include. In this case, a typed description of your workbook, how many sheets it will have, what those sheets will contain, how many charts you intend to build, and their descriptions.

### Spreadsheet

You must first decide what kind of workbook you want to create. You have a considerable amount of freedom in this decision, but here are a couple of suggestions to get you started. One of the things that you must consider, however, is that you are not allowed to use templates. You can use templates for inspiration and guidance, but the spreadsheet you create must be your own work and it must be relevant to the use-case that you would envision for it.

<dl>
    <dt>A family/event/business budget.</dt>
    <dd>Keep track of finances, bills, income, and savings.</dd>
    <dt>Fitness tracker</dt>
    <dd>Keep track of exercise, calories burned, calories consumed, and other data for keeping track of a healthy lifestyle.</dd>
    <dt>Student Gradebook</dt>
    <dd>Create a gradebook to keep track of student work, assignments, homework, and calculate grades</dd>
    <dt>Scientific Data</dt>
    <dd>You can use Excel to keep track of and analyze scientific data. For this, you may need to look somewhere to find a dataset that interests you and import it into Excel. Then you will use it to calculate some statistics, perhaps, and/or build some charts. In class, we will look at some possible sources for data.</dd>

This is not an exhaustive list. You can think outside the box and create any spreadsheet you like. Though I do ask that you run your ideas by me so that we can come up with a plan for how to approach it and discuss what sorts of sheets, charts, and other calculations would be useful or interesting to include in the workbook. You should discuss it with me personally in any case.

The data for your spreadsheet can come from anywhere. You can either make it up completely, or find a dataset online (I can help you look for something if you like).
