Project - Slides Show and Tell
==============================

Here's your chance to flex some slideshow muscle. For this project, you're going to build a short slide show about something you have some knowledge of and could theoretically give a five or ten minute speech about. You'll have the opportunity to show off your Slides skills *and* some special knowledge that you have. Think of it as a show-and-tell.

You can refer to any of my slides from earlier in the semester for examples.

### Instructions

1. Think of something you have knowledge about and could talk about for five minutes (You will *not* have to present these, though!). Some examples:
    * A sport
    * A type of pet
    * A hobby
    * A profession
1. Open up a fresh PowerPoint file and begin to craft a brief presentation
1. Shoot for five or six slides with four to five bullets per slide.
1. Try to find pictures for each slide.
1. Apply transitions to all slides and animations to as many slides as you can.
1. You will **not** have to deliver this as a presentation. Merely submit it as normal as a file to Canvas.
1. Let the Designer pane do some of your heavy lifting.

Your slide show must exhibit the following features:
----------------------------------------------------

-   You must use a theme other than the default
-   You must use images on more than half of the slides
-   You must have at least 5 slides
-   You must have a title slide
-   You must use transitions and animations
-   No low-effort submissions.

Good luck, have fun!
