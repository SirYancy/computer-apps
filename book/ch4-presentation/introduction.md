# Introduction

With the increasing ubiquity of large screen televisions and projectors,
presentation software has become increasingly central to many office and
education jobs. Teachers use them to present important information and
supplement lectures (sometimes a little too much). Likewise, anyone
trying to pitch an idea, give an informational speech, or share
information online will often use a presentation app like Microsoft
PowerPoint to enhance their presentation. In fact, the word
"presentation" has, for good or ill, become somewhat synonymous with
this kind of software (though often specifically referring to Microsoft PowerPoint).

Crafting a useful, informative, and professional-looking presentation is
more art than science. Trying to include just the right amount of
information on any one slide and the right blend of images and graphics
with text takes a little practice. That said, Slides and most other
modern presentation software have a lot of tools which can make this
task a little easier.

As always, this chapter focuses mostly on Google's offering,
**Slides**, but most of the principles apply to other office suites
like **PowerPoint** and **LibreOffice Impress**.
