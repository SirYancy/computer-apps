Continuing our fundamental foray into the world of desktop publishing with Microsoft Word, let's play around with a few more tools while we build a simple newsletter.

Tools Covered
-------------

Columns

: Splitting a document into two or more columns can make reading easier and enhance the visual impact of a document.

Drop Caps

: Make the first letter in a document extra large as a decorative enhancement.

Unordered Lists

: Make a list of items that makes information easier to digets.

Breaks

: Break your columns and sections where *you* want them broken.

TUTORIAL
--------

### The Header

First, let's make the header look a bit better using some Word Art and Quick Styles.

1. Copy the start file to your Google Drive in the usual fashion. For your convenience, links to the three images we'll be inserting are also included here. Feel free to open them in separate tabs so that they'll be easier to locate when we need them.

    * [Start File](https://bit.ly/3bVWrFP)
    * [Image 1](res/drone.jpg)
    * [Image 2](res/soldering.jpg)
    * [Image 3](res/floral.jpg)

1. Open the file and look over the contents.

    ![initial file](images/tutorial4/1.png)

1. First, select the first paragraph of text, which reads "QuadCopter Competition". In the **Insert** menu, select **Drawing**, and then **New**.

    ![Insert a drawing](images/tutorial4/2.png)

1. In the *Drawing* canvas that appears, select **Actions** and then **Word Art**.

    ![Word Art](images/tutorial4/3.png)

1. In the box that appears, type "QuadCopter Competition" and press **Enter**.

    ![Enter Word Art](images/tutorial4/4.png)

1. With your new Word Art selected, play around with the fill and outline colors of the text. You may choose whichever colors you wish, but choose a lighter one for the fill color and a darker one for the border.

    ![Select Colors](images/tutorial4/5.png)

    When you are satisfied, click **Save and Close**. Observe the result.

1. Next, select the second paragraph, which says "Leech Lake Tribal College". Center this text.

    ![Center text](images/tutorial4/6.png)

1. With the second paragraph still selected, click on the **Sytle Menu** which currently says *"Normal Text"* and select **Subtitle**.

    ![Subtitle](images/tutorial4/7.png)

    The resulting text is a little large, so let's drop the size down to 12pt.

    ![Change size of subtitle](images/tutorial4/8.png)

### Columns

Adding columns is simple, however in our case, it will require some careful sectioning of the document to make sure the text still flows correctly and doesn't interfere with the formatting we've already established.

1. Place the *insertion point* at the beginning of the line that says "What is a drone?" (Just click at the beginning of that line). In the **Insert** menu, select **Break** and then select *Section Break (continuous)*. The space between the subtitle and the rest of the text will get slightly larger, but otherwise, it won't be apparent that anything has changed. But this is necessary for the next step.

    ![Section Break](images/tutorial4/9.png)

1. In the **Format** menu, select **Columns**, and select the two-column option. Observe the result.

    ![Two Columns](images/tutorial4/10.png)

1. Now, at this point, the columsn are very unbalanced. So let's fix that. Place the insertion point at the beginning of the paragraph that starts with the word **When**:

    ![Place Insertion Point Here](images/tutorial4/11.png)

    In the **Insert** menu, select **Break** and then **Column Break** and observe the result.

    ![Column Break](images/tutorial4/12.png)

### Lists and Drop Caps

Next, we want to enhance the visual appeal of the document by adding some visual cues and stylistic elements.

1. Lists are a great way to enhance readability of a document like this. In the second section of the document, some of the information could be presented as a list. Select the two paragraphs indicated in here:

    ![Select these paragraphs](images/tutorial4/13.png)

1. Click on the **Bullet list** tool on the toolbar and observe the result.

    ![Bullet List](images/tutorial4/14.png)

1. Next, let's create a Drop Cap. You may have seen pictures of illuminated text in old books. We are going to create a simpler, more modern version of this by making the first letter of the first paragraph larger than the surrounding text. First, highlight the "W" at the beginning of the document.

    ![Select the W](images/tutorial4/15.png){: width="30%}

1. Once again, in the **Insert** menu, select **Drawing** and then **New**.

    ![Create a new drawing](images/tutorial4/16.png)

1. Click **Actions** and select **Word Art** once again. In the text box, simply type a capital "W" and press **Enter**

    ![Create another Word Art](images/tutorial4/17.png)

1. This time, set the fill and border colors both to black. Click **Save and Close**.

    ![Set fill and border to black](images/tutorial4/18.png)

1. Initially, the new letter is just way too big and it's not positioned correctly. Select it by **clicking** on it.

    ![Select the new word art](images/tutorial4/19.png)

1. Next set the **Wrap Text option** and then set the margin to 0".

    ![Set wrap text](images/tutorial4/20.png)

1. Now, simply make the W smaller by dragging the bottom-right corner handle up and to the left. Try to get it down to about two lines of text tall.

### Images

Let's add some images. This is one of the issues with word processors and desktop publishing that many people take issue with, citing examples of times when they've added an image or re-sized the image and it has thrown the entire document into disarray. But with a few simple tricks, it's actually quite simple to add images that fit in the document and do not throw off your formatting.

1. If you do not have the image already open in another tab, you can find it here: **[drone.jpg](res/drone.jpg)**. You can also copy it from below by simply right-clicking on this image:

    ![drone image](res/drone.jpg)

1. Place the **insertion point** near the beginning of your document. Somewhere in the first line. It doesn't matter exactly where. Now, with the image in your system's clipboard, simply press **Ctrl-v** or click on the **Edit** menu and select **Paste**. The result will be something like this:

    ![Inserting drone image](images/tutorial4/22.png)

1. This *has* thrown the entire document into disarray. But we will fix it. First, set the **Wrap Text** option, and then set the margin to 1/16"

    ![Wrap Text](images/tutorial4/23.png)

1. Now, resize and reposition the image so it fits nicely in the top right corner of the left column. Observe the alignment guides as they appear while you move it around. The text will flow around the image and the result will be much cleaner. Try to get it looking like this:

    ![resize and position image](images/tutorial4/24.png)

1. Next, **right-click** on [this link](res/soldering.jpg) and click **open in new tab**. In that new tab, **right-click** on the image and select **copy image**. This will, again, copy the image data to your system clipboard.

    ![Copy image to clipboard](images/tutorial4/25.png)

1. Move the insertion point to the end of the document, after the final text that says "sign up!". In the **Edit** menu, select **Paste** or simply press **Ctrl-v**.

    ![Insert second image](images/tutorial4/26.png)

1. Turn on **Wrap Text** and then re-size the image so it's slightly smaller and then center it in the column using the guide lines that will appear as you move it around. Get it looking kind of like this:

    ![Resize and position second image](images/tutorial4/27.png)

1. The last image is [here](res/floral.jpg). It is an image of the floral motif from the school website. Insert it into the document however you like, and then set **Wrap Text** and resize and position it so it is centered at the bottom of the document and spans the entire page. Like this:

    ![Resize final image](images/tutorial4/28.png)

    **Don't forget to set Wrap Text**

With this, the newsletter is complete and should look something like this:

Submit it to the course portal as normal.
