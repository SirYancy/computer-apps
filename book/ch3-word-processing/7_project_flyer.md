Discussion
----------

For this tutorial, your job is to create your own flyer, newsletter, or other image-featuring document in Google Docs. This time, it is your job to generate all the content and source all the images.

As discussed in the tutorial, building an eye-catching, effective flyer or newsletter
in Docs is quite simple. It should catch the reader's eye, be easy
to read, and have some way of attracting a person closer
to read the fine print. Images should be used to accentuate your points without overwhelming or confusing the issue.

Your task is to generate your own flyer or newsletter for a fictional event, sale, or
informative lesson. Some possible inspiration:

-   A lost pet
-   A found pet
-   A garage sale
-   Some object(s) for sale
-   A party or cultural event
-   An informative public service announcement

Requirements
------------

The content and styling are totally up to you. Be as creative as you
wish. But it must have the following features:

-   More than one image.
-   Appropriately sized fonts, other than the defaults, but legible.
    - Use Word Art or other text effects as you wish.
-   You must use both text colors and shading somewhere in the flyer
-   You must have margins set appropriate to the content.
-   You must use other appropriate styling to make the text stand out.
    Include bold, italic, underlines, or other text effects.
-   No low-effort submissions. Make it look as
    though you are genuinely trying to sell the subject. But feel free to be creative or humorous.

Other considerations
--------------------

-   Keep it tasteful. Too much clutter on a flyer can turn people away.
-   Have enough information that a person can react appropriately (such
    as including contact information).
