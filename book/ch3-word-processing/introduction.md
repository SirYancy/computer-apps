# Introduction

Word processing software's purpose is to allow the user to create
professional-looking documents like letters, flyers, and brochures.

Typesetting as a practice is as old as the written word. But modern
typesetting began with the printing press and many of the principles that were
developed in the early days of the printing press still apply to modern
word processing. It wasn't until the 1960s that word processing by
computers and software began to be explored. The idea was to duplicate
what a typewriter does, only in software. They've come a long way since
IBM's first word processing Selectric typewriter. Google Docs will be
the primary focus of this chapter.
