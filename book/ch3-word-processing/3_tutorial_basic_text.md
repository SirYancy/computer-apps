Word processing is, at its most fundamental, the process of manipulating
text. Microsoft Word is a highly robust, feature-rich word processor.
However, in order to get at the most advanced features, we should take a
look at some of the basic tools and methods at our disposal in the
modern word processing environment.

In the following tutorial, we are going to write a basic block-style
letter. In the process, we are going to gain experience with the
following tools:

Insertion Point

:   The blinking line that indicates where text appears when you type.

Paragraph and Line Spacing

:   How to recognize the default line and paragraph spacing in MS Word
    and how to change it.

Spellchecking

:   How Word identifies spelling and grammar errors and how we can use
    these tools to make our words flow better.

TUTORIAL
========

1.  Open a new blank document in Word. Ensure that the rulers and
    non-printing characters are visible. Check the [Chapter
    introduction](1_word_tour.html) if you can't remember where these are.
    Your window should look like this:

    ![A brand new Word document](images/tutorial2/1.png)

2.  We are going to write a block-style letter. This means that all of
    our text will be aligned to the left, paragraphs will be styled as
    blocks, and we must include the addresses of the sender and receiver
    at the top of the letter. As luck would have it, most of this fits
    well with Word's default settings. First, type the address of the
    sender as follows. Press the **Enter** key wherever you see the
    carriage return (&crarr;) symbol

    <pre>
    1212 Elm St. &crarr;
    Bemidji, MN 56601 &crarr;
    </pre>

3.  Next, type the date:

    <pre>
    June 27, 2017 &crarr;
    </pre>

4.  Next, type the sender's address as follows:

    <pre>
    Jasper Gemstone &crarr;
    310 Pillsbury Drive SE &crarr;
    Minneapolis, MN 55455-0231 &crarr;
    </pre>

5.  Now, type the salutation:

    <pre>
    Dear Dr. Gemstone, &crarr;
    </pre>

    Your document should look like this:

    ![Addresses, date, and
    salutation](images/tutorial2/2.png)

6.  Type the following paragraph *exactly* as it appears here (typos and
    all):

    <pre>
    Thank you for taking the time to resond to my question. Enclosed is an image of of the stone I found on my hike a couple weeks ago. I belive it is a meteorite, but my friends don't agree. So I wanted to ask someone more knowledgable about the subject. I know their is only a small chance that it is a meteorite, but I wanted to make sure. &crarr;
    </pre>

7.  When you are finished, notice that Word has detected a number of
    errors in the text. It has automatically underlined these errors
    based on what kind of error it is. Underlined in red squiggly lines
    are spelling and repeated word errors. Double blue underlines are
    usually punctuation errors. Sometimes, errors automatically
    correct themselves. In the last sentence, when you typed the word
    "their", it automatically detected this as the wrong word and
    corrected it to "there". If, for some reason, it did not, then it at
    least detected it and will have underlined it in blue.

    ![Spelling and Grammar errors are underlined in
    different ways.](images/tutorial2/3.png)

8.  There are a couple of different ways to correct spelling and grammar
    errors that are detected by Word. **Right-click** on the first
    error, the word "resond". The context menu will bring up a list of
    possible replacement words. The first one is often the correct one,
    but always make sure.

    ![Right-clicking is a good way to quickly fix
    single errors.](images/tutorial2/4.png)

9.  To proof the rest of the document, let's use the **Spelling &
    Grammar** tool. Go to the **Review** tab. In the far left
    **Proofing** group, click on the **Spelling & Grammar** tool. If you
    copied the above text faithfully, the first error that should pop up
    is the repeated "of".

    ![The Spelling & Grammar tool gives you a full-featured interface to
    check for errors in
    your text.](images/tutorial2/5.png)

    Click the **Delete** button to fix the first error. Go through each
    of the rest of the errors and take the suggested fix for each one.
    If you have different errors than shown here, feel free to fix those
    as well.

10. Type the following paragraph as it appears here:

    <pre>
    I understand that you are very busy and I appreciate you taking the time to verify this for me. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at &lt;yourname&gt;@email.com. &crarr;
    </pre>

    Where it says "yourname", enter your name. Notice that when you hit
    enter to create the next paragraph, the email address is
    automatically underlined in blue. Word has detected that it is an
    email address and has converted the text into a **hyperlink**. As a
    general rule, if you are going to be submitting the document
    electronically, you would leave the hyperlink as it is, but if you
    are going to be printing the document and hand-delivering or mailing
    it, then you should remove the hyperlink since you can't exactly
    click on a piece of paper.

11. To remove the hyperlink, **right-click** on it and in the
    context-menu that appears, **left-click** on *Remove Hyperlink*

    ![Remove the hyperlink](images/tutorial2/6.png)

12. To close the letter, type:

    <pre>
    Sincerely, &crarr;
    &crarr;
    &lt;your name&gt;
    </pre>

13. Our last task is to fix some of the formatting. Remember that
    whenever you press the **Enter/Return** key, Word creates a
    new paragraph. Observe how the paragraphs of this document
    are spaced. Notice that inside the longer paragraphs, the lines
    are single-spaced. That is, they are all scrunched up, visually
    creating a cohesive unit of information. Between each paragraph,
    Word inserts an extra line of white space. Normally, this is fine.
    But at the top of the document, it doesn't look right that the
    addresses are double-spaced like that. To remove this extra
    whitespace, click once in the margin to the left of the first line:

    ![Select just the first line of
    text](images/tutorial2/7.png)

14. The cursor will flip backwards to indicate that you are in the
    right place. With the first line selected, in the **Paragraph**
    group of the **Home** tab, click the **Line and Paragraph
    Spacing** tool. In the menu that opens, click **Remove Space After
    Paragraph**.

    ![Remove the space after the paragraph](images/tutorial2/8.png)

    The return address should now look like one block of text.

15. Next, we do the same thing with the recipient's address. Observe
    carefully, though. Only select the first two lines of the address,
    that is, the name "Jasper Gemstone" and the street address "310
    Pillsbury Drive SE".

    ![Just select the first two lines of the
    address](images/tutorial2/9.png)

16. Once again, remove the space after the paragraphs in the **Line and
    Paragraph Spacing** menu. Observe how the addresses and the date now
    are spaced logically so that the eye sees them as discrete pieces
    of information.
17. Last, but certainly not least, if you zoom out and look at the
    document as a whole (you can zoom using the slider at the
    bottom-right corner of the window), you will notice that all of the
    text of the letter is scrunched up at the top of the page leaving
    all of the blank white space at the bottom. It will look better when
    it's printed if we balance the whitespace equally at the top and
    the bottom. To do this, we could just add a bunch of new lines at
    the top of the document. But, for a cleaner approach, we'll just
    increase the size of the top margin. In the **Layout** tab, find the
    **Margins** tool in the **Page Setup** group. None of the defaults
    is appropriate, so we will select the **Custom Margins** option at
    the bottom of the menu.

    ![Custom Margins](images/tutorial2/11.png)

    In the dialog that opens, feel free to browse all of the tools that
    are available here and when you are ready, change the top margin to
    *3* inches and press **OK**.

    ![Change the top margin to 3
    inches](images/tutorial2/12.png)

18. Your final file should look like this.

19. Save the document and submit it to the class portal as normal.
