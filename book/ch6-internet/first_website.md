Building a simple website these days is potentially very simple. If you have a basic command of a web browser, a word processor, and confidence moving files around, you will be able to build something that looks professional and attractive.

For the purposes of tutorials and projects in this course, we will use [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/). The basics of using this platform will be covered in class, and if you miss the class where we cover it, take a shot at figuring out the interface yourself. If you have any questions, problems, or concerns, ask a classmate or the instructor.
