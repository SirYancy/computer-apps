Chrome OS
=========

Google's Chrome OS is an app that is quickly gaining in popularity. The chief reason for this is cost. Chromebooks (the portable computers which run Chrome OS) are not expensive. They have low-end hardware that leverages internet (cloud-based) services to do most of their heavy lifting. For this reason, they do require an active internet connection to be even remotely useful, but there are things you can do with them in offline mode.
