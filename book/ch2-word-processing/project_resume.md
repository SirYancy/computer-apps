Project 3 - Resume
==================

[Example File](res/project_3.pdf)

Discussion
----------

It's probably safe to say that at some point in your life, you will have
to write a resume or dust of and revise an old one. We all find
ourselves looking for new work occasionally. This project is designed to
give you practice with working from a template and exporting to an
immutable pdf format. It is possible that you will also get a workable
resume out of it, though it is highly recommended that you run it by a
career counselor before handing it out to prospective employers.

Skills Covered
--------------

-   Downloading and working with Word templates
-   Working with and exporting to the immutable **Portable Document
    Format** or **PDF**

Terminology
-----------

Template

:   A standard document with pre-determined layout, fonts, colors, and
    design used to make designing of documents easier.

Document Control

:   In a template, a bit of dummy text with formatting applied that is
    meant to be deleted or replaced with real text.

Portable Document Format (PDF)

:   A type of computer document format that has two main qualities.
    First, it is difficult to edit (immutable) and change making it
    ideal for important documents like resumes and cover letters.
    Second, it contains all of the formatting and layout information in
    the file so that it will look exactly the same no matter what
    software, operating system, or hardware the document is being viewed
    with; thus, how you set it up is how it is going to look for whoever
    reads it.

Getting Started
---------------

1.  Open the Microsoft Word app on your computer.
2.  Instead of opening a new blank document, we're going to look for
    a template. The Microsoft servers have thousands of templates to
    choose from in a searchable online database. Look for the search bar
    at the top of the window. Click on it and type "Resume".

3.  For the purposes of this project, you can choose any template that
    you like, but I recommend the Basic Resume template as it is easy to
    use and easy to follow along. Select your chosen resume and click
    the **Create** button.

    appropriate](images/project3/2.png){: width="100%"}

4.  When the file opens up, it's basically a fill-in-the-blank form.
    Scattered throughout the document is dummy text boxes called
    **Document Controls**. Click where it says **Your Name** at the top
    of the page. Notice that whole thing is selected. Simply begin
    typing your own name and it will replace the document control and
    already be formatted.
5.  Fill in the rest of the heading with your name and
    contact information. If you don't want to, you don't have to use
    real information. Feel free to be as creative or silly as you wish,
    just so long as it *looks* professional.
6.  Start filling in the rest of the resume template with your
    own information. Use the **document controls** to make this easier
    as they say exactly what information belongs there.
7.  When filling in a section like the work experience section, the
    template typically only gives you one template to work with. So to
    include multiple jobs, you'll have to duplicate that template. This
    is actually pretty easy. First, select the text of the job
    description template as shown here:

    ![Select text to duplicate](images/project3/3.png){: width="100%"}

    Next, **copy** the text with either the **Copy** tool in the
    **Clipboard** group of the **Home** tab, or hit **Ctrl-C** on
    your keyboard. Now that the selected text is in the clipboard, move
    the insertion point to the end of the text and press **Enter** to
    create a new paragraph. It should look like this:

    ![Make some room for the new
    templaten](images/project3/4.png){: width="100%"}

    Finally, hit the **Paste** button or press **Ctrl-v** to paste the
    duplicate template. You should now have two identical sets of
    document controls to fill in with your information.

    ![Now you have two sets of
    document controls.](images/project3/5.png){: width="100%"}

8.  The rest of this project should speak for itself. Continue to fill
    in the rest of the resume with whatever information you wish. Again,
    be creative if you like, but at least make it *look* professional.
    Once you are finished, there is one more thing we need to do before
    uploading the final project.

    To export the document to **portable document format (PDF)**, first
    save your work as normal so you have a backup copy. Next, to export
    it, click the **File** tab to get to the backstage view. In the
    backstage menu, click the **Export** option. Next, click **Create
    PDF**.

    ![Exporting the file to a PDF](images/project3/6.png){: width="100%"}

    Notice when the save dialog opens, at the bottom of the dialog, the
    line **Save as type** is set to **PDF**. Press the **Publish**
    button and your work is done.

9.  Upload the PDF file to the portal to complete this project.
