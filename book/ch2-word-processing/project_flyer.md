Project 2 - Fancy Formatting
=================

Before completing this project, ensure that you have completed the
formatting tutorials:

-   [Tutorial 3 - Formatting Text and
    Images](tutorial_formatting_images.html)
-   [Tutorial 3.5 - More Formatting](tutorial_newsletter.html)
-   [Example Finished
    Flyer](res/tutorial3.pdf)

Discussion
----------

For this tutorial, your job is to create your own flyer, newsletter, or other image-featuring document in Microsoft Word. This time, it is your job to generate all the content and source all the images.

As discussed in the tutorial, building an eye-catching, effective flyer or newsletter
in Word is quite simple. It should catch the reader's eye, be easy
to read, and have some way of attracting a person closer
to read the fine print. Images should be used to accentuate your points without overwhelming or confusing the issue.

Your task is to generate your own flyer or newsletter for a fictional event, sale, or
informative lesson. Some possible inspiration:

-   A lost pet
-   A found pet
-   A garage sale
-   Some object(s) for sale
-   A party or cultural event
-   An informative public service announcement

Requirements
------------

The content and styling are totally up to you. Be as creative as you
wish. But it must have the following features:

-   An image with a style applied
-   Appropriately sized fonts, other than the defaults, but legible
-   It must use both text colors and shading somewhere in the flyer
-   It must have margins set appropriate to the content.
-   It must use other appropriate styling to make the text stand out.
    Include bold, italic, underlines, or other text effects.
-   Even if it's silly, no low-effort submissions. Make it look as
    though you are genuinely trying to sell the subject.

Other considerations
--------------------

-   Consider using theme colors so that you can apply different themes
    to see how it changes your document.
-   Keep it tasteful. Too much clutter on a flyer can turn people away.
-   Have enough information that a person can react appropriately (such
    as including contact information).
