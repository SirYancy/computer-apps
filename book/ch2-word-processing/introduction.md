# Introduction

Word processing software's purpose is to allow the user to create
professional-looking documents like letters, flyers, and brochures.

Typesetting as a practice is as old as the written word. But modern
typesetting began with the printing press and many of the principles the
developed in the early days of the printing press still apply to modern
word processing. It wasn't until the 1960s that word processing by
computers and software began to be explored. The idea was to duplicate
what a typewriter does, only in software. They've come a long way since
IBM's first word processor Selectric typewriter. Microsoft Word will be
the primary focus of this chapter.

The computers on campus run Word 2013, however, many of the screenshots
in this section will be of Word 2016. The differences are largely
cosmetic, however, and where functional differences exist, they are
usually behind the scenes.
