=======================================

Here's the [Start File](https://bit.ly/3cAKwNN)

This project is straightforward. It's a practice with pivot tables. If you don't remember how to make a manipulate a pivot table, check the [Tutorial 6](6_tutorial_tables_pivot.html).

Inside the spreadsheet, you will find a set of sales data. You'll want to format the data so that it is more readable. The fields in the table are as follows:

* OrderDate
* Region
* Rep
* Item
* Units
* Unit Cost
* Total

Note that the total column is not filled in with values.
