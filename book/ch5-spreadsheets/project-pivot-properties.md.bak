=======================================

Here's the [Start File](res/property_pivot_start.xlsx)

This project is straightforward. It's a practice with pivot tables. If you don't remember how to make a manipulate a pivot table, check the Tutorial 6 and and Project 3.

Inside the spreadsheet, you will find a listing of properties and their values and other attributes. Your task is simple. Create a pivot table from the data. Find all of the properties that have

* a medium garden
* 3 bedrooms
* 2 bathrooms
* located in town.

There will be hints offered by the instructor, but if you miss class today, you *have* covered enough in class to solve this on your own. You may just have to think outside the box a little bit.
