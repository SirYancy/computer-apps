In this tutorial, you'll primarily want to follow the video walk-through. This is sort of a grand tour of some advanced functions and tools in Google Sheets, as well as a look at how to add functionality to all G-Suite apps using **Add-ons**.

This tutorial covers the following:

IF() Function
:   A function that allows you to set the value of a cell based on some test condition

SUMIF() Function
:   A function which allows you to *add* a series of values, but only if some condition hold true for each.

Absolute References
:   We've already done this a bit, but for second year students, it's worth a refresher with this more complex version of this table.

VLOOKUP() Function
:   A vertical look-up is a way of looking up a values from a row in a table based on some index value.

Add-ons
:   Sheets (and most other high-quality software) is highly extensible. So we are going to add functionality to Sheets using the add-on system. Specifically we are going to find a way to add the following functionality to a spreadsheet

Data Tables and "What-if" analysis
:   This is a killer tool in MS Excel. Fortunately, programmer Jeffrey Yang has created a [free add-on](https://github.com/sajacy/google-sheets-what-if-analysis) for Google Sheets which replicates the functionality of Data Tables in Sheets!
