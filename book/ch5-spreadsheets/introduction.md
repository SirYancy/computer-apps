# Introduction

The spreadsheet's purpose is to bring order to numerical data. With a
spreadsheet app like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel, you can take raw data that is very
hard for humans to parse and create readable, engaging, and useful
tables, charts, and graphs. These graphs can be imported into any other
document such as a slideshow presentation or a text document.

The spreadsheet is the software that earned the computer its keep. The
promise of being able to speed up the processing of tabular data is what
convinced many corporations in the early days of computing to spend
incredible sums of money on computers that, by today's standards, were
very rudimentary. The modern spreadsheet application is kind of like a
programming language in itself. Even with a basic understanding of
tables, tabular data, and spreadsheet software you can make data entry
and processing a far easier task and even impress potential employers.

**Note:** As always, these tutorials and projects will primarily use
screenshots from Word 2016. If you are working with Word 2013, and
something doesn't look the same or work the same way, please inform the
instructor.
