========================

This is it. The most fundamental family spreadsheet activity. Building a budget. This is the single most useful tool that a personal user of a spreadsheet app will find. It requires dedication and planning, but once the spreadsheet is set up, the whole process is, more or less, automated, requiring only that a person/family track their spending and transactions and make sure to enter them into the spreadsheet regularly.

Tools
-----

Data Validation
:   To ensure that only certain input can be in a certain cell *and* create nifty drop-down menus in our cells.

SUMIF()
:   Using the `SUMIF()` function again to add only specific numbers to get breakdowns of expenses by category.

SPARKLINES()
:   We're going to build a couple of different sparklines to enhance the look of the spreadsheet and give a visual indicator of our data for a more intuitive understanding of it.

Fill Handle
:   It's important to remember how absolutely essential this tool is, so we're going to use it to make our work a little less annoying.

Functions and formulas
:   We're going to take a look back at making sure we're building an understanding of what functions and formulas are appropriate and where. And how to recognize some bugs.
